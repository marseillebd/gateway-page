  <h1>Marseille Bouchard Demko's Homepage</h1>
  <p>
    I am a software engineer interested in designing ergonomic systems for writing reliable, performant, evolvable software.
    I strongly believe that formal mathematics is a powerful tool to sharpen one's ideas, and is especially under-used in software development, where fuzzy ideas breed bugs.
    I draw on developments in dependent type theory, and seek to ground them in application to systems, library, and application programming.

      I never want to write a parser again.
      E-exprs are based on s-exprs, but allow several more forms to aid with the ergonomics.
      Highlights include: indented blocks, separating terms by commas/semicolons, dot-access syntax.

      a Haskell port of the <a href="https://nanopass.org/documentation.html">Nanopass Compiler Framework</a>.
      I absolutely fell in love with this idea when I first saw it, but I was unwilling to give up static typing.
      Now, I have statically-typed nanopass, and I can rest easy again.

  <h3>The Zedo Build System</h3>
  <p>
    Inspired by <a href="https://cr.yp.to/redo.html">DJB's redo proposal</a>, I periodically experiment with improvements to the interface and specification.
    These are still not quite stable or fully-featured, but every time I look at it again, I get a little closer.

  <h3>Language Experiments</h3>
  <p>
    This section is more for my own notes.
    I frankly have too many irons in the fire/pots on the stove/planes in the sky/whatever, and it's nice to have some sort of overview.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/marseillebd/bsvm">BVSM</a>:
      a virtual machine that could reasonably be hand-compiled if necessary.
      I thought it would be useful as a ground for bootstrapped compilers, bit it turns out that I need to balance the ground language for both ease of implementation and implementing _with_.
      It may be possible to pivot into lisp-like semantics if I can build a simple-enough garbage collector.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/marseillebd/chimney">C Shim Library</a>:
      contains common C algorithms that usually just keep getting re-implemented.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/marseillebd/ediacara">Ediacara</a>:
      a portable assembler because C isn't.
      Ediacara should have assembly notions built-in from the start: "advanced" control-flow (like tail-calls and escape continuations), and arbitrary calling conventions per-function.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/marseillebd/fpgc">Functional Programming Garbage Collector</a>
      aims to be a standard garbage collector written in C for general-purpose functional programming language runtimes.
      It is currently just some notes on what I need to support and how I might do it.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/marseillebd/anemone">Anemone</a>
      attempts to pack as many abstractive features as possible (i.e. first-class everything) into a language;
      the focus is on operational rather than static semantics
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Random Corner</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/marseillebd/env-cabal/settings">env-cabal</a>: find exes produced by cabal and put them <code>&lt;project&gt;/bin/</code></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/marseillebd/haxplay/settings">haxplay</a>: because music players keep screwing up my metadata</li>
    <!-- <li><a href="https://clock.edemko.net">a clock/astrolabe</a> I started work on a while back</li> -->
    <li><a href="https://github.com/marseillebd/sfcc">My Master's Thesis</a> which describes first-class continuations and their applications. I don't actually recommend reading it unless perhaps you want an introduction to their uses. However, I realized literally days after defending it that there's an improvement to be made to the formal system, and I've only found more improvements since.</li>
  </ul>

    <a id="to-footnote-1" href="#from-footnote-1">[1]</a>:
    Which is <em>not</em> to say that test suites are never useful!
    I personally think that writing a test suite for a parser is less work
      than trying to figure out and formalize every property that the parser should have.
